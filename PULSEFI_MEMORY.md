# PulseFi Project Memory

This file is the grouped project context for PulseFi. It should be read before continuing major backend work, especially when starting a new step.

## Project Overview

PulseFi is my Final Year Project: a Smart Network Monitoring and Optimization System.

The system helps users and ISP admins monitor, analyze, and optimize internet usage.

Core idea:
- Collect usage and connected-device data from router/network source.
- Show total usage, connected devices, per-device usage, alerts, predictions, recommendations, and device network policies.
- Help users avoid exceeding their plan.
- Help ISP admins manage users, plans, routers, usage records, reports, alerts, recommendations, and analytics.

Main roles:
- Platform Admin: creates/manages ISPs and ISP Admins.
- ISP Admin: manages app users, plans, subscriptions, routers, reports, and monitoring.
- App User: uses the mobile app to view usage, devices, alerts, predictions, recommendations, and apply device optimization actions.

Current stack:
- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: async SQLAlchemy
- Mobile app later: React Native + TypeScript
- Admin dashboards later: web dashboards for Platform Admin and ISP Admin

## Working Preferences

When helping with PulseFi backend:
- Explain before giving big code blocks.
- Explain what file is edited, why it is needed, what the code does, and how it fits the architecture.
- Mention whether each change affects database schema, existing data, GitHub, tests, or SE diagrams.
- Do not create huge mixed-responsibility files.
- Split schemas, services, endpoints, and dependencies early when responsibilities grow.
- Keep code modular and clean.
- Use the GitHub backend repo as source of truth when needed: https://github.com/MadaraPDL/backend
- User is manually typing/running code locally in `C:\PulseFi\backend`.

## Completed Backend Foundation

The FastAPI backend foundation is complete:
- Project structure created under `app/`.
- `app/main.py` runs the FastAPI app.
- `app/core/config.py` loads settings from `.env`.
- `app/core/security.py` handles password hashing, JWT creation/decoding, secure tokens, token hashing, and numeric codes.
- `app/db/session.py` handles async SQLAlchemy database sessions.
- `app/api/v1/router.py` connects API routers.
- Health endpoint works.
- Swagger/OpenAPI works.

Security decisions:
- Passwords use Argon2 through `pwdlib[argon2]`.
- JWT uses `SECRET_KEY`, `ALGORITHM`, and access-token expiry.
- JWT payload includes `sub`, `account_type`, `iat`, and `exp`.
- Login requires `account_type` because admins and app users are stored in separate tables.

## Database / Models Status

Core PostgreSQL schema is already created.

Core model set is complete and import-tested:
- ISP
- Admin
- AppUser
- SubscriptionPlan
- UserSubscription
- Router
- Device
- DeviceConnectionLog
- UsageRecord
- Prediction
- Recommendation
- Alert
- DeviceNetworkPolicy
- RouterActionLog
- SubscriptionChangeRequest
- Report

Auth model set is complete and import-tested:
- AccountInvitation
- EmailVerificationToken
- PasswordResetToken
- MFABackupCode
- MFAChallenge

Important database/auth design:
- Account invitations are used instead of temporary passwords.
- Email verification is included.
- Forgot password uses expiring reset tokens.
- Admins and app users can log in with email or username.
- Usernames are optional, unique case-insensitively, and no spaces.
- MFA foundations are included.
- Backup codes should be single-use and stored hashed only.
- Authenticator secrets should be encrypted in the final deployable version.
- SMS verification is deferred.

## Auth Progress

Auth schemas were split under `app/schemas/auth/`:
- `common.py`
- `login.py`
- `mfa.py`
- `invitation.py`
- `password_reset.py`
- `email_verification.py`
- `current_user.py`

Auth services were split under `app/services/`:
- `account_service.py`
- `auth_service.py`
- `mfa_service.py`
- `invitation_service.py`
- `password_reset_service.py`
- `email_verification_service.py`

Auth endpoints were split under `app/api/v1/endpoints/auth/`:
- `login.py`
- `mfa.py`
- `invitations.py`
- `password_reset.py`
- `email_verification.py`
- `me.py`

Auth endpoints currently include:
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/mfa/verify`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/invitations/accept`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/password/forgot`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/password/reset`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/email/verify`
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me`

## Step 14 Completed

Step 14 is complete and pushed.

Feature:
- Protected current-account route system.

Files added/split:
- `app/api/dependencies/auth_scheme.py`
- `app/api/dependencies/current_account.py`
- `app/api/dependencies/role_guards.py`
- `app/api/dependencies/__init__.py`
- `app/api/v1/endpoints/auth/me.py`

What works:
- Bearer token extraction.
- JWT decoding.
- Current account loading from admin/app_user table.
- Active account check.
- Admin-only dependency.
- App-user-only dependency.
- Admin role guard.
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me`.

Test result:
- Login through PowerShell worked.
- `/auth/me` returned the logged-in platform admin successfully.

GitHub:
- Step 14 pushed as commit `f2dcf09 Add protected current account dependencies`.

## Step 15A Completed

Step 15A is complete and pushed.

Feature:
- Platform Admin ISP management.

Endpoints:
- `POST /api/v1/platform-admin/isps`
- `GET /api/v1/platform-admin/isps`
- `GET /api/v1/platform-admin/isps/{isp_id}`
- `PATCH /api/v1/platform-admin/isps/{isp_id}`

Files added:
- `app/schemas/platform_admin/isps.py`
- `app/schemas/platform_admin/__init__.py`
- `app/services/platform_admin/isp_service.py`
- `app/services/platform_admin/__init__.py`
- `app/api/v1/endpoints/platform_admin/isps.py`
- `app/api/v1/endpoints/platform_admin/__init__.py`

What works:
- Platform Admin can create ISP.
- Platform Admin can list ISPs.
- Platform Admin can get one ISP.
- Platform Admin can update ISP info/status.
- `created_by_admin_id` is correctly saved.
- `updated_at` updates correctly.

## Step 15B Completed

Step 15B is complete and pushed.

Feature:
- Platform Admin creates ISP Admin invitations.
- Invited ISP Admin accepts invitation.
- Platform Admin lists ISP Admins under an ISP.

Endpoints:
- `POST /api/v1/platform-admin/isps/{isp_id}/admin-invitations`
- `GET /api/v1/platform-admin/isps/{isp_id}/admins`
- Uses existing `POST /api/v1/auth/invitations/accept`.

Files added:
- `app/schemas/platform_admin/admin_invitations.py`
- `app/services/platform_admin/admin_invitation_service.py`
- `app/api/v1/endpoints/platform_admin/admin_invitations.py`

Important fix:
- The route prefix in `admin_invitations.py` must be `router = APIRouter(prefix="/isps/{isp_id}")`.
- Correct routes are:
  - `/api/v1/platform-admin/isps/{isp_id}/admin-invitations`
  - `/api/v1/platform-admin/isps/{isp_id}/admins`

What works:
- Platform Admin creates an ISP Admin invitation.
- Development response returns `dev_invitation_token` while `DEBUG=True`.
- Invited ISP Admin accepts invitation.
- ISP Admin account is created with `role="isp_admin"`.
- ISP Admin is linked to the correct `isp_id`.
- `created_by_admin_id` is linked to the inviting Platform Admin.
- Platform Admin can list ISP Admins under the ISP.
- ISP Admin can log in.

## Current Next Step

Next step:
- Step 15C: Platform Admin manages ISP Admin accounts.

Likely scope:
- View one ISP Admin.
- Update ISP Admin basic info/status.
- Deactivate/reactivate ISP Admin.
- Keep route protection as Platform Admin only.
- Keep files split under platform_admin schemas/services/endpoints.

Possible endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/platform-admin/isps/{isp_id}/admins/{admin_id}`
- `PATCH /api/v1/platform-admin/isps/{isp_id}/admins/{admin_id}`

## Pending Later Roadmap

After Step 15:
- Step 16: ISP Admin management endpoints.
- Step 17: User mobile app endpoints.
- Step 18: Router adapter/simulator layer.
- Step 19: Usage data ingestion.
- Step 20: Alerts system.
- Step 21: Prediction/recommendation logic.
- Step 22: Reports and analytics.
- Step 23: Frontend integration.
- Step 24: Deployment preparation.

## Pending SE Diagram Updates

Batch-update SE artifacts later for:
- Invitation-based onboarding.
- Email verification.
- Forgot password.
- Username login.
- MFA/2FA.
- Protected routes/current-user flow.
- Router adapter/capability architecture.
- Subscription change request flow.

Do not interrupt coding for tiny implementation details, but mention SE updates when changes affect actors, roles, use cases, DFD processes/data flows, ERD entities/attributes/relationships, sequence/activity diagrams, onboarding/security architecture, or router/deployment structure.

## Latest Progress Update

Step 15C is complete and tested:
- Platform Admin can view one ISP Admin.
- Platform Admin can update ISP Admin full name, phone number, and status.
- Platform Admin can deactivate/reactivate ISP Admins.
- ISP Admin management remains protected by `platform_admin` role only.

Step 15D is complete and tested:
- Added Platform Admin dashboard summary endpoint.
- Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/platform-admin/summary`
- Summary returns counts for ISPs, ISP Admins, and App Users by status.
- This is read-only and does not modify database rows.

Current next step:
- Step 15E: Platform Admin pending ISP Admin invitation management.
- Planned endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/platform-admin/isps/{isp_id}/admin-invitations`
  - `PATCH /api/v1/platform-admin/isps/{isp_id}/admin-invitations/{invitation_id}/revoke`

## Latest Progress Update

- Platform Admin can list ISP Admin invitations for an ISP.
- Platform Admin can filter invitations by pending, accepted, revoked, or expired.
- Platform Admin can revoke a pending ISP Admin invitation.
- Revoked invitations cannot be accepted.
- Revoke keeps the invitation row for audit history by setting `revoked_at`.

Step 15 is now complete for Platform Admin MVP:
- 15A: Manage ISPs.
- 15B: Invite ISP Admins.
- 15C: Manage ISP Admin accounts.
- 15D: View Platform Admin summary metrics.
- 15E: Manage pending ISP Admin invitations.

Current next step:
- Step 16: ISP Admin management endpoints.

## Latest Progress Update — 2026-05-14

Backend quality improvements completed:

- Limited PostgreSQL runtime role `pulsefi_app` created and tested.
- Backend local `.env` uses `pulsefi_app` instead of `postgres`.
- Alembic initialized and baseline migration created.
- Existing database stamped to Alembic baseline.
- Pytest/httpx testing foundation added.
- Health endpoint test added.
- GitHub Actions backend CI added and confirmed passing.

Important DB permission reminder:

- `pulsefi_app` is intentionally limited and is not table owner.
- It can run the backend but cannot safely perform all schema migrations.
- Future production setup should use:
  - restricted runtime app DB role
  - separate migration/admin DB role for Alembic/schema changes

Step 16 ISP Admin progress:

- Step 16A completed and tested: ISP Admin router foundation and protected summary endpoint.
- Step 16B completed and tested: ISP Admin App User invitation endpoints.
- Step 16C completed and tested: ISP Admin App User list/detail/update endpoints.
- Step 16D completed and tested: ISP Admin subscription plan management endpoints.
- Step 16E completed and tested: ISP Admin user subscription assignment/list/detail/update endpoints.

Step 16E database migration:

- Added Alembic migration `285ab0474b39_allow_suspended_user_subscription_status.py`.
- Updated `user_subscriptions.status` check constraint to allow:
  - `pending`
  - `active`
  - `suspended`
  - `expired`
  - `cancelled`
- `suspended` means a subscription is temporarily stopped, such as unpaid bill/admin action.
- Migration SQL had to be applied locally through pgAdmin/admin because `pulsefi_app` is not owner of `user_subscriptions`.
- Alembic should be stamped to head after manual local application.

Current next step:

- Step 16F: ISP Admin router management endpoints.

Step 16F expected rule:

- Routers must be linked only to user subscriptions under `current_admin.isp_id`.
- Every router query must verify ownership through the linked user subscription and App User ISP.

---

## Step 16 Progress — 2026-05-14

### Step 16F — ISP Admin Router Management Endpoints

Completed and tested:

- Added ISP Admin router schemas.
- Added ISP Admin router service logic.
- Added endpoint module: `app/api/v1/endpoints/isp_admin/routers.py`.
- Added endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/isp-admin/routers`
  - `GET /api/v1/isp-admin/routers`
  - `GET /api/v1/isp-admin/routers/{router_id}`
  - `PATCH /api/v1/isp-admin/routers/{router_id}`
- Connected router endpoints to the ISP Admin router.
- All endpoints use `get_current_isp_admin`.
- Router creation verifies the target `user_subscription_id` belongs to an App User under `current_admin.isp_id`.
- Router listing/detail/update is scoped by `Router.isp_id = current_admin.isp_id`.
- Tested fetching an active user subscription.
- Tested creating a router linked to the subscription.
- Tested listing routers.
- Tested viewing one router by ID.
- Tested updating router name, model, IP, API endpoint, and status.
- Tested setting router status to `maintenance`.
- Tested reactivating router status back to `active`.

Router credential decision:

- Step 16F does not accept or store router passwords.
- `password_encrypted` exists in the database model for future real-router integration.
- Router credentials should only be added later after secure encryption helpers are implemented.
- Do not store raw router passwords.

Current router status values:

- `active`
- `inactive`
- `maintenance`

Impact:

- Database schema: no change.
- Existing data: only local test router data changed during endpoint testing.
- SE diagrams: later update ISP Admin use cases/activity flow to include router management.
- Security: Step 16F confirms router actions are scoped by `current_admin.isp_id`.

Next Step 16 work:

- Add ISP Admin dashboard/summary endpoint or Step 16 final cleanup/testing.
- Continue using `get_current_isp_admin`.
- Continue filtering all ISP Admin queries by `current_admin.isp_id`.

## AI Assistant Workflow Preferences

When helping with PulseFi, the assistant/Codex should follow these rules:

### Explanation style

- Give step-by-step instructions.
- Explain what each command or code block does.
- Explain which file is being edited.
- Explain why the edit is needed.
- Explain how the change fits the PulseFi architecture.
- Mention whether each change affects:
  - database schema
  - existing data
  - GitHub
  - tests
  - SE diagrams
- Do not dump large code without explaining it.
- When possible, explain under or near each code block, not only at the end.

### Coding style

- Keep files modular.
- Do not create huge mixed-responsibility files.
- Split schemas, services, endpoints, and dependencies by feature area.
- Endpoint files should stay thin.
- Business logic should go in services.
- Do not rewrite unrelated code.
- Do not invent database fields.
- Check existing models/database before writing code that depends on schema details.

### Workflow style

- Before starting a new step, check the current Git status.
- Before coding a new feature, check the relevant existing files.
- After coding, run import checks, pytest, compile checks, and git status.
- Test endpoints through PowerShell/Swagger before committing when the feature affects API behavior.
- Save important decisions in repo docs before committing.
- Keep `PULSEFI_MEMORY.md` as the compact source of truth for future chats.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` useful for Codex/AI coding assistants.
- Keep `ROADMAP.md` updated with current phase and next step.
- Keep `BACKEND_QUALITY_BACKLOG.md` updated with quality/security/deployment reminders.

### Logging/output style

- For successful commands, the user can summarize instead of pasting huge logs.
- For errors, paste the important error section.
- The assistant should identify the exact failing line/error and provide a focused fix.
- Avoid making the chat unnecessarily heavy with repeated huge logs.

### Security and local files

- Never ask the user to commit `.env`.
- Never ask the user to commit local passwords or tokens.
- `LOCAL_TEST_ACCOUNTS.md` is local only and should stay ignored by Git.
- Router passwords should not be accepted or stored until encrypted credential storage exists.
- Do not store raw router passwords.
- Do not expose access tokens in docs or GitHub.

### Memory/update rules

- After finishing a major backend step, update:
  - `PULSEFI_MEMORY.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `ROADMAP.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `BACKEND_QUALITY_BACKLOG.md` when the change affects quality/security/deployment
- Add dates for completed milestones when possible.
- Mention pending SE diagram updates when backend/design changes affect actors, flows, use cases, DFDs, ERDs, activity diagrams, or sequence diagrams.

---

## Step 16G — ISP Admin Dashboard Summary

Completed and tested:

- Replaced the temporary ISP Admin summary endpoint with real dashboard metrics.
- Endpoint:
  - `GET /api/v1/isp-admin/summary`
- Added ISP Admin summary schemas.
- Added ISP Admin summary service logic.
- Summary returns ISP-scoped counts for:
  - App Users
  - Subscription Plans
  - User Subscriptions
  - Routers
- Subscription counts are scoped through the linked App User because `user_subscriptions` does not directly store `isp_id`.
- All summary queries remain scoped to `current_admin.isp_id`.
- Tested successfully with an ISP Admin token.

Impact:

- Database schema: no change.
- Existing data: no change.
- SE diagrams: later update ISP Admin dashboard/use-case flow to include dashboard summary metrics.
- Security: confirmed ISP Admin summary only reads data under the logged-in admin's ISP.

Next step:

- Step 16 final cleanup/testing and documentation update.
- Then continue to Step 17: App User mobile endpoints.


---

## Critical New Chat Rule

When starting or continuing PulseFi in a new chat, the assistant must not guess from old chat context.

Before giving implementation steps, read or ask the user to provide the latest repo state from:

- `PULSEFI_MEMORY.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `README.md`
- `BACKEND_QUALITY_BACKLOG.md`

The assistant must follow the workflow style saved in `PULSEFI_MEMORY.md` and `AGENTS.md`:

- give step-by-step instructions
- explain every code block/command
- keep files modular
- check existing files/models before coding
- run import checks, pytest, compile checks, and git status before commit
- update repo memory/docs after major backend steps
- never commit `.env`, local passwords, tokens, or `LOCAL_TEST_ACCOUNTS.md`
- do not store router passwords until encrypted credential storage exists

Current backend state:

- Step 16A through Step 16F are complete and tested.
- Current next work is Step 17: App User/mobile endpoints.

---

## Step 17 Progress — 2026-05-14

### Step 17A — App User Mobile Endpoint Foundation

Completed and tested:

- Added App User schema package under `app/schemas/app_user/`.
- Added App User service package under `app/services/app_user/`.
- Added App User endpoint package under `app/api/v1/endpoints/app_user/`.
- Added endpoint:
  - `GET /api/v1/me/summary`
- Connected App User routes to the main API router.
- Endpoint uses `get_current_app_user`.
- Endpoint uses the logged-in App User from the access token.
- Endpoint does not accept `user_id` from the request.
- Summary returns safe App User profile fields and subscription counts.
- Tested App User login.
- Tested `/api/v1/me/summary` with an App User token.
- Tested that an ISP Admin token cannot access `/api/v1/me/summary`.

Returned summary fields:

- `id`
- `isp_id`
- `full_name`
- `email`
- `username`
- `phone_number`
- `status`
- `email_verified_at`
- `created_at`
- `total_subscriptions`
- `active_subscriptions`

Security rules:

- App User mobile endpoints must use `get_current_app_user`.
- App User `/me` endpoints must never accept a target `user_id` from the request.
- App User `/me` endpoints must use `current_user.id` from the token.
- Do not expose password hashes, MFA secrets, reset tokens, or sensitive auth fields.

Impact:

- Database schema: no change.
- Existing data: read-only endpoint. Local test password may have changed if password reset was used for testing.
- SE diagrams: later update App User/mobile activity and sequence diagrams to include protected `/me` mobile endpoint flow.
- Security: Step 17A confirms App User-only route protection works.

Next Step 17 work:

- Add App User subscription endpoints.
- Likely endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/me/subscriptions`
  - `GET /api/v1/me/subscriptions/{subscription_id}`
- Continue using `get_current_app_user`.
- Continue using `current_user.id`; do not accept user IDs for App User self-service routes.

---

## Step 17 Progress — 2026-05-14

### Step 17B — App User Subscription Endpoints

Completed and tested:

- Added App User subscription schemas.
- Added App User subscription service logic.
- Added endpoint module: `app/api/v1/endpoints/app_user/subscriptions.py`.
- Added endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/me/subscriptions`
  - `GET /api/v1/me/subscriptions/{subscription_id}`
- Connected subscription endpoints to the App User router.
- Endpoints use `get_current_app_user`.
- Endpoints use the logged-in App User from the access token.
- Endpoints do not accept `user_id` from the request.
- Subscription list/detail queries are scoped by `UserSubscription.user_id = current_user.id`.
- List endpoint supports optional status filter:
  - `?status=pending`
  - `?status=active`
  - `?status=suspended`
  - `?status=expired`
  - `?status=cancelled`
- Response includes nested subscription plan summary data.
- Tested listing the logged-in App User's subscriptions.
- Tested viewing one subscription by ID.
- Tested filtering subscriptions by `status=active`.
- Tested that an ISP Admin token cannot access `/api/v1/me/subscriptions`.
- Tested that a fake/non-owned subscription ID returns `Subscription not found`.

Security rules:

- App User `/me` endpoints must use `get_current_app_user`.
- App User `/me` endpoints must never accept a target `user_id`.
- App User `/me` endpoints must only use `current_user.id` from the token.
- Do not expose another user's subscriptions.
- Do not expose sensitive auth fields.

Impact:

- Database schema: no change.
- Existing data: read-only endpoints.
- SE diagrams: later update App User/mobile activity and sequence diagrams to include subscription list/detail flow.
- Security: Step 17B confirms subscription access is scoped to the authenticated App User.

Next Step 17 work:

- Add App User router/device view endpoints, or App User usage endpoints.
- Continue using `get_current_app_user`.
- Continue using `current_user.id`; do not accept user IDs for App User self-service routes.
